Today i learnt about the this keyword in js

The this keyword refers to the context where a piece of code, such as a function's body, is supposed to run. Most typically, it is used in object methods, where this refers to the object that the method is attached to, thus allowing the same method to be reused on different objects.

1. In a Regular Function (non-strict mode)
   function show() {
   console.log(this);
   }
   show(); // 'this' refers to the global object (window in browsers)
